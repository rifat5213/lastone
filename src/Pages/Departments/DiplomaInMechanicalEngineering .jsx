            The Diploma Programme in Mechanical Engineering provides skills in the fields of manufacturing and production needed in industries and offers knowledge to adopt the changes in techniques, technologies, markets, and employment patterns.
            <br /><br />
            This program has been designed to cope with the modern trends in technologies and industry needs. Nowadays, most of the machinery is equipped with computer numerically controlled systems. This demands the inclusion of electronics and computer programming in the curriculum. The course emphasizes hands-on practice and collaborations with industries in addition to conventional classroom learning.
            <br /><br />
            The Diploma in Mechanical Engineering in Bangladesh is one of the most established engineering courses, with a history that began long before our independence. Many mechanical diploma graduates are working in various industries. The demand for these professionals is growing rapidly with the modernization and expansion of sectors such as Railways, Automobiles, Shipping, Ship Building, Machine Tools, Agricultural Equipment, Electrical Power Generation, and more.
            <br /><br />
            The Bangladesh Technical Education Board (BTEB) introduced the Diploma in Mechanical Engineering Program to meet the growing demand for mechanical diploma engineers in the country. Like other diploma courses, the Diploma in Engineering Program comprises 8 semesters over four years.
            <br /><br />
            The fields of higher education for mechanical diploma engineering graduates are vast. They can gain admission to public and private universities. Dhaka University of Engineering & Technology (DUET), a specialized university only for diploma engineers, offers a B.Sc. level program where many mechanical diploma graduates continue their education. Every year, many students go abroad for higher education in this field.
