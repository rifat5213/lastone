            Diploma in Electrical Engineering is a 4-year long program consisting of 8 semesters (1 Semester = 6 months).
            <br /><br />
            The final and the midterm exams of each semester are conducted under the supervision of the Bangladesh Technical Education Board (BTEB).
            All the exam questions, answer script checking, and final results are published by the BTEB.
            <br /><br />
            Besides this, each student has to attend the regular class tests, quiz tests, and semester final projects.
            After successful completion, a student will receive a Diploma in Electrical Engineering Certificate.
            <br /><br />
            The Admission procedure starts after the SSC results.
            There is mainly one session in a year.
            Students have to follow the admission announcement, which is given by the Bangladesh Technical Education Board Authority.
            Usually, the admission procedure starts after May (depending on the SSC Result).
            <br /><br />
            Electrical engineers use physics, electronics, and electromagnetism to design devices that are powered by or produce electricity.
            Electrical engineers work on anything from small pocket devices to large aircraft electrical systems.
            <br /><br />
            Engineers test prototypes and evaluate and improve systems.
            Nearly every industry has a place for an electrical engineer, including government, transportation, communications, technology, and utilities.
