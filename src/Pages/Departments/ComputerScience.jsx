            The Diploma in Computer Science & Technology course is highly enriched with a solid foundation in computer hardware engineering, networking, and software engineering, as well as profound depth in digital electronics.
            <br /><br />
            Emphasis is given on learning how to use and apply computer technology to control and connect activities and communication through digital networks, while bearing in mind the latest cyber security protocols. Skills and knowledge required to develop applications for computers and mobile devices are also taught to empower the students to be well-rounded computer engineers.
            <br /><br />
            Digital Bangladesh implies the broad use of information technology for management, administration, and governance to ensure transparency and accountability at all levels of society and the state. The study of computer engineering is the backbone of information technology. The graduates of the diploma in computer engineering are the main workforce behind making Digital Bangladesh a reality.
            <br /><br />
            The diploma in engineering program, offered by the Bangladesh Technical Education Board (BTEB), is an excellent course to produce skilled diploma graduates in this field to meet the enormous demand of the country. The duration of the course is 8 semesters in 4 years.
            <br /><br />
            The scope of higher education for diploma engineering graduates is vast. They can get admission in public and private universities. Dhaka University of Engineering & Technology (DUET), a specialized university only for diploma engineers, offers a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering. Many students in the field of diploma computer engineering are going abroad for higher education.
